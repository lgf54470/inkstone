/**
 * Chart colours derived from the site's accent — the same arithmetic the app's
 * `src/client/lib/markdown/chart/palette.ts` performs, kept as a sibling copy because the two packages
 * share no runtime (the blog's own `deep-imports` gate stops it reaching into `src/client`).
 *
 * A chart library's default palette is a rainbow chosen by nobody for the benefit of everybody, and it
 * sits badly against a page whose whole identity is one accent. So the series colours are built from
 * that accent instead: the accent itself, its own tint and shade, and then the two hues a designed
 * group is made of — the complement taken as a saturated spot, and a lean toward the complement's
 * neighbour. That is the shape the reference groups have (a slate base, its lighter and darker
 * siblings, one gold spot, one mauve), and it keeps a multi-series chart reading as this page. A
 * reader's chart is thereby the colours the author saw while writing the note.
 *
 * oklch is where the arithmetic happens, because the tokens are written in it and its lightness axis
 * is perceptual (a ladder of equal steps *looks* like equal steps, which hsl does not give).
 *
 * The answer is sRGB hex, though, and that is not a style choice: echarts' painter parses the colours it
 * is given — it interpolates a `visualMap` range, it lifts a colour for the hover state, it takes a
 * sankey link's colour from its source node — and `zrender`'s parser returns nothing at all for an
 * `oklch()` string. Every one of those paths then falls back to black, or to transparent, which is why
 * a heatmap drew as a black box and a bar vanished under the pointer while an ordinary fill, which the
 * browser paints itself, looked fine.
