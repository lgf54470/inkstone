/**
 * What one card owes another (KU-23, ADR-0006). A card's `dependsOn` names the cards that must be
 * done before it — the blockers — and the direction is the only thing the rest of the module needs
 * to agree on: an edge runs from the blocker to the card that lists it, and every read below is
 * built from that one rule. The list lives on the item in the JSON body; the outline body has no
 * slot for it, so it survives only the way views and subtasks already do — the first write from a
 * UI promotes the fence to JSON before anything is lost.
 *
 * Reads are tolerant rather than tidy: a hand-written fence may carry a list of numbers, a name for
 * a card that is not there, or the card itself. Junk is read as nothing (never a crash), and what
 * the editor writes back is always the normalized shape.
