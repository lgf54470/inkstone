/**
 * What a commit means for the way back — the rule the board's undo is built on, stated in two halves.
 *
 * `view` is a *lookup*: how an existing view shows the board, and which view is open. The search, the
 * filters, the tags, the sort, the size of a card, which columns a table hides, which columns a card
 * prints, what the board groups or swimlanes by, how a chart is drawn, and `activeViewId`. A lookup is
 * written into the document exactly like an edit — that is what keeps it across a reload and lets a
 * second reader open the same view — but it does not take a step: a reader who narrows a board ten times
 * and then presses Ctrl+Z means the last *edit* they made, not a walk back through ten lookups. Before
 * this, a handful of filters could push a session's real edits off the end of the thirty-step history.
 *
 * `edit` is everything else, and takes a step: a card, a subtask, a comment, a column or one of its
 * options, the board's title, and which views exist (the tab strip's create, rename, duplicate, delete
 * and move — the delete toast's undo is built on the delete being a step at all).
 *
 * The halves split by *who is changing*, not by which field is under the cursor, so a field added to a
 * view later needs no decision made about it: dropping its write through `useKanbanViewState` (or
 * beside it, as the grouping picker does) is the whole answer.
 *
 * The price is stated rather than hidden: undo restores a whole document state, so a lookup made after
 * the last edit does not survive the undo either. Keeping it would mean storing the view half of every
 * snapshot apart from the rest and re-applying it on the way back — a second history model to keep in
 * step with the first, for a case a reader can already redo by touching the chip again.
