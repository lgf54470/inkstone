/**
 * The board's four habitual questions, one press each.
 *
 * Every chip is the rule the filter panel would have taken several presses to build, and it is written
 * into the same `filters` list — so a chip that is pressed shows up as a row in the panel (and can be
 * edited there), and a rule built by hand lights the chip up. The chips are drawn only when the board's
 * own schema can answer them: a board with no date column is never late and has nothing due today, so
 * it is offered no chip rather than a chip that matches nothing.
 *
 * "Mine" is the account's own name matched against the person column, because that column stores the
 * name the author typed and carries no link to an account. An account whose name differs from the one
 * on the cards — or a board where the same person is spelled another way — will find fewer cards than
 * they expect; the alternative (a chip that cannot be built at all) is worse than a filter they can
 * see, read and delete.
