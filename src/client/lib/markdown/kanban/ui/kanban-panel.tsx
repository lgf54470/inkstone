/**
 * One anchored panel for the whole board: placed from the control it hangs off — right- or
 * left-aligned to it, under it, flipped above it when the room below runs out, clamped to the box it
 * may be drawn in, and never larger than that box (it scrolls instead of spilling past the edge that
 * would cut it).
 *
 * It stays in the tree rather than moving to `document.body`, and that is a decision rather than a
 * shortcut. The full screen board is a `Modal`, whose dialog focus trap cycles `Tab` inside the
 * dialog's own subtree — a panel parked in the body would be unreachable by keyboard, which is the
 * one thing the board may not lose. `position: fixed` in the same tree is no better: the overlay shell
 * carries `anim-pop`, whose settled transform becomes the containing block of a fixed child, and the
 * header's own container query adds a `contain` to that chain. So the panel keeps `position: absolute`
 * and does its own placement, which is also why the jsdom tests keep finding it exactly where they
 * did: `role`, `id` and `aria-label` all stay put and the trigger keeps `aria-controls`/`aria-expanded`.
 *
 * The offset is written against whatever box the panel turns out to be positioned in, and that box is
 * *measured* rather than asked for: `offsetParent` is not that box in every engine (`container-type`
 * on an ancestor — which the compact header carries — makes a containing block for absolute children
 * without necessarily appearing in the `offsetParent` chain). Pinning the panel to `0,0` for one
 * layout pass and reading where it landed names the box exactly, in viewport coordinates, once per
 * open. (`usePanelPlacement` in `components/popover-placement.ts` is the same algebra for callers
 * that position their panel inside a `relative` wrapper they own; this one owns no wrapper, so it has
 * to find its own origin — and clamp to everything that would clip it, see `clipPanelViewport`.)
 */

/**
 * How a form control looks inside a board panel.
 *
 * The panels are a quarter the width of a settings page, so they keep the project's `Select` (its own
 * chevron, its focus ring, its base type) and only re-state its density: the height a settings row can
 * afford is not the height a rule row can. Everything else — the border, the surface, the focus — comes
 * from the shared component, so a panel control and a settings control cannot drift apart.
