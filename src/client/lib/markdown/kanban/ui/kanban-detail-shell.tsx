 * The full screen board's shell: the card stands beside the board, so the columns a reader is
 * working through stay in view while the card is open, and the next one can be picked without
 * leaving them.
 *
 * It carries its own head and foot so the card's name stays editable at the top and the destructive
 * action stays reachable at the bottom while the middle scrolls, which a drawer's single scroll area
 * does not do on its own. `Z_INDEX.menu` is the tier an overlay takes above a full screen surface —
 * the same move the music hub's drawers make — and it is required rather than decorative here: the
 * board itself is a modal at `--z-modal`, so a drawer at the default `--z-drawer` would be painted
 * behind the very board it peeks from.
