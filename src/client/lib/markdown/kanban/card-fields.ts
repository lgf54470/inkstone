/**
 * Which of a board's own columns a card prints beneath its title.
 *
 * A card used to draw a fixed set — tags, a description excerpt, subtasks, a deadline, a priority and
 * an attachment count — and nothing else, so a column a reader had added (an environment, an estimate)
 * was reachable only by opening the card or switching to the table. The gap is not that the board
 * cannot *show* such a value but that it was never asked to: the value is in the document, and the
 * card simply had no way to be told about it (the review of 2026-09-23 recorded the board's own
 * values as incomplete for exactly this reason).
 *
 * A view therefore carries `cardFields`: the columns it wants printed on its cards, in the order they
 * are read. Absent means none — every existing board keeps the card it had, and the ordered list is
 * what tells the card which values to put beside its title and in which order. Configuring the *fixed*
 * regions (turning the subtask list or the tags row off) is deliberately not part of this: those are
 * what the card has always drawn, and removing them changes every board that never asked.
 *
 * The value of a field is read here rather than at each surface, so a card, a future gallery card and
 * a list row cannot disagree about what an option, a day or a person reads as — the same rule the
 * date badge follows for the card's own deadline.
