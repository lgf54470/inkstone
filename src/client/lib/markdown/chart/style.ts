/**
 * The `style=` annotation a chart fence may carry: `style=json` for a body made of data (a chart.js
 * config, an echarts option), `style=table` for a Cherry table body.
 *
 * The body already says which of the two it is, so this is not how a format is *discovered* — it is how
 * the note states one, and stating one changes what the block says when the body is not readable. A
 * table whose `--- |` row has a typo in it is recognisable as a table but not parseable as one, and a
 * block that has to guess then answers a JSON question about a table. With the format stated the right
 * reader runs, and its message is the one about the row. A value that names neither is reported rather
 * than ignored, because `style=tabel` asks for something no block draws, and redrawing as though the
 * note said nothing would hide the typo.
