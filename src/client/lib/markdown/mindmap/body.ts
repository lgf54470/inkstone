/**
 * DOM-free helpers behind the ```mindmap fence: format detection, EOL handling
 * and the fence surgery that two-way editing needs (the map's own writes, and the
 * header's palette control). The vendor-backed parse/serialize pair lives in ./vendor,
 * so this file (and its tests) can be imported without pulling mind-elixir into the
 * caller's chunk.
 *
 * The surgery itself is not mind map specific — any block that rewrites its own
 * fence needs the same locate-and-replace — so it lives in ../fence-edit and this
 * module only adds what a mind map fence carries on top: its languages, its two
 * body formats, and the palette annotation on its info line.
