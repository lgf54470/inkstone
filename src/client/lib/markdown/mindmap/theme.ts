 * the app's appearance setting is what a body that names nothing draws with
 * (`"auto"`, or no `theme` field at all). Switching the app theme therefore
 * repaints the maps that follow it and leaves the pinned ones alone, and the same
 * rule holds everywhere a map is drawn: the preview, the full screen view, the
 * share page, the slides and every export all resolve one of these choices.
 *
 * The field is JSON-only, and that is why the fence's info string carries the same
 * statement for the formats that cannot hold it: ` ```mindmap theme=dark ` is read by
 * the same reader the JSON field goes through, so the two cannot drift apart.
