/**
 * What one turn of the page costs the deck's two list surfaces — the rail beside the projector and
 * the overview grid that roams the whole deck. Every card runs the same three hooks: is it near the
 * viewport, what markup does its slide hold, how is that page sliced. Counting those hooks counts
 * the cards that re-ran, and a turn or a measurement ought to move two of them, not the deck.
