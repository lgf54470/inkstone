/**
 * Bridges the mind map registry (pure view state) to the note store: the map's
 * operations are serialized into the fence it came from, and the header's palette
 * control rewrites that fence.
 *
 * The fence is resolved against the note's *current* text, not against the
 * markup the preview rendered from: the user may have typed since, and writing
 * on top of a stale snapshot would throw those edits away. When the fence no
 * longer holds the body the map was built from, nothing is written and the user
 * is told, because silently dropping either side would be worse.
