/**
 * Which shares a folder, a tag, a status filter or a published collection covers — stated once for
 * both halves of the app. The worker turns these rules into SQL (`worker/lib/share-selection-sql`);
 * the client evaluates them in JS, and in this app that also means the demo backend, which is the
 * client-side twin of the worker. A rule written out once per surface is a rule that can disagree
 * with itself, and these had: a tag collection matched a tag *id* against `shares.tags`, an array of
 * tag *names*, and the "active" rule a collection page applied was a second copy of the one the list
 * applies.
 *
 * A target has two forms, and the difference between them is the point:
 *
 * - `ShareTargetRecord` addresses a folder or tag *record* by id. That is what the owner selects, what
 *   the worker's batch routes take, and what `share_collections.target_value` stores (the record is
 *   what renames the published page);
 * - `ShareTarget` is what a share itself stores: `shares.folder_id`, or one element of `shares.tags`.
 *   Note the asymmetry — a folder is stored by id, a tag by name — because the tag array holds the
 *   names the owner's tags had when the share was last written.
 *
 * `resolveShareTarget()` is the only conversion between the two, and every predicate below takes an
 * already resolved target, so no caller has to know which form it is holding.
