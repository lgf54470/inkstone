/**
 * SH-49 asked for interactive controls to come from the component system, and for a `div`/`span`
 * with a click handler never to be passed off as one. That guard only read `features/share`, so the
 * shared components every feature uses kept the very shapes it forbade — the hub rows were
 * `div[role=button]` rows, and an account with any tag made the share center's own axe pass report
 * `button-name` and `nested-interactive` (SH-93). This reads the whole client tree instead.
 *
 * Three rules, in the order they matter:
 *
 *  1. No `div`/`span` that says `role='button'`. A fake control is wrong wherever it is, so this
 *     applies everywhere, with no exceptions: the last three the rule tolerated were the kanban
 *     board's card, its gallery tile and its list row, and each was a card that opened a detail and
 *     held controls of its own (SH-107). Redesigning the card — the title is a real button, the card
 *     is a container — took all three entries away rather than keeping an exemption nobody needs.
 *  2. Every raw `<button>` has to carry an accessible name — `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`,
 *     `title`, or visible text. This is the `button-name` rule axe applies, read statically, and it
 *     is what the 37 unnamed icon buttons across the app were failing. Names are read from the
 *     element's own attributes and its subtree: a name a wrapper component injects, or one spread
 *     in with `{...rest}`, is not something this can see, so an entry is never needed for it — but a
 *     raw button that only *looks* named because of a wrapper is not caught here either. That limit
 *     is the price of not rendering the app; the browser gates read what a real screen reader sees.
 *
 *     What counts as text was measured against a browser rather than guessed: an expression that
 *     renders an element — `{expanded ? <ChevronDown/> : <ChevronRight/>}` — is an icon, not a
 *     label, and axe reports those buttons as unnamed. Reading any expression as text (which is what
 *     this rule did at first) called eight icon-only buttons named while the browser called them
 *     nameless: the kanban board's row, group and list expand toggles, the attachment drive's two
 *     selection cells, a folder icon picker and the blog category colour swatches. `{t('…')}` and
 *     `{name}` are still text: they are what a label is usually written as, and no static read can
 *     tell a bare identifier apart from a variable holding an icon.
 *  3. Inside `src/client/components` — the layer every feature shares — a raw `<button>` needs a
 *     written reason. These are the primitive implementations and the rows and cells whose geometry
 *     the primitives cannot express (a menu row stretches a flexible label between two fixed slots,
 *     a calendar cell is a grid track); the rule's job is to keep the next one from arriving
 *     unnoticed, not to relitigate the ones already argued.
 *  4. A container with a hit target of its own — a click or pointer-down handler on a `div`/`span`/
 *     row element — must not hold a control. This is the half of SH-107 rule 1 could not see: taking
 *     the `role` off a card that holds its own buttons leaves a click target that *looks* like a
 *     container, and the browser still reads `nested-interactive` (and, without a keyboard path, a
 *     keyboard cannot reach the card at all — the same shape SH-110 fixed in three more views). A
 *     pointer-down on a drag handle is read too: it is the other way a container becomes a hit
 *     target. What is left after both fixes is five sites, every one of them a container whose
 *     handler *stops* a click from reaching an outer one rather than being the affordance — each is
 *     listed with its reason and its count, so a new one, or a sixth in a listed file, fails here.
 *
 * Features outside that layer are not required to funnel every button through the primitives: that
 * is a per-context judgement (146 files and 397 sites today), and an allowlist of 146 entries would
 * be a graveyard rather than a reason. Rules 1 and 2 are the part that holds for them.
 *
 * Both directions fail throughout: an unlisted file that grows a violation, and an entry for a file
 * whose violation is gone.
